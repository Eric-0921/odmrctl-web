### 6.12 SENSE, READ and INITiate Subsystems

The SENSE subsystem contains the commands for configuring the power measurements with R&S NRP-Zxx power sensor(s) connected to the generator. The measurement is started and the measurement result retrieved with the READ command. The description of this commands is included in the following.

Up to four sensors can be connected to the signal generator. They are distinguished by means of the suffix under SENSE, that means SENSE [1] ... SENSE 4.

The suffixes <ch>

Furthermore the following suffixes denote:

• Sensor assignment READ<ch> and INIate<hw>; range: [1] to 4

• Sensor mapping list: ELEMENT<ch>; range [1] to 25

Manual operation: See "Auto Once" on page 177

##### :SENSE<ch>[:POWER]:FILTER:TYPE <Type>

The command selects the filter mode. The filter length is the multiplier for the time window and thus directly influences the measurement time.

##### Parameters:

<Type>

##### AUTO | USER | NSRatio

##### AUTO

The filter length is automatically selected depending on the measured value. For high values, a short filter length is selected and for low values a long filter length is selected.

##### USER

The filter length is set manually. As the filter length works as a multiplier for the measurement time, this results in a constant measurement time.

##### NSRatio

The filter length (averaging factor) is selected so that the sensor's intrinsic noise (2 standard deviations) does not exceed the specified noise content. The desired noise content is entered with command SENSE: FILTer:NSRatio.

To avoid very long settling times when the power is low, the averaging factor can be limited with the Timeout parameter (command SENSE: FILTer:NSRatio:MTIME).
