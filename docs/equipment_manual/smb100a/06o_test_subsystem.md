TEST:DIR? 'SSYN', 0
Response: #H12345678

### 6.17 TRIGger Subsystem

The TRIGger system contains the commands for selecting the trigger source for the RF and LF sweep. The trigger input connectors are configured in the SOURce:INPUT subsystem.

The trigger system of the R&S SMB is a simplified implementation of the SCPI trigger system. The TRIGger system differs from the SCPI system as follows:

- No INITiate command; the instrument behaves as if INITiate:CONTINUOUS ON were set.

• Under TRIGger several sweep subsystems exist.

Other commands associated with the trigger system of the R&S SMB can be found in the modulation and RF signal subsystems.

• Suffix TRIGger<1|2> is not permitted

TRIGger<hw>

• TRIGger0 activates the LF output.

### 6.18 UNIT subsystem

The UNIT subsystem contains the commands specifying which units are valid if no unit is indicated in a command. These settings are valid for the entire instrument.

#### :UNIT:ANGLE <Angle>

Defines the default unit for the phase modulation angle. It is not valid for commands which determine angle values, e.g. RF phase. It does not influence the manual control parameter unit and the display.

Parameters:
<Angle> DEGRee | RADian
*RST: RADian

Direct Commands for the Stereo/RDS Coder Option R&S SMB-B5

Example: UNIT: ANGL DEG

sets DEG as a default unit for all commands which determine angle values.

:UNIT:POWER <Power>

Defines the default unit for power parameters. This setting affects the GUI, as well as all remote control commands that determine power values.

Parameters:

<Power> V | DBUV | DBM

*RST: DBM

Example: UNIT: POW V

sets V as a default unit for all commands which determine power values.

### 6.19 Direct Commands for the Stereo/RDS Coder Option R&S SMB-B5

The direct command allow to access all functions of the stereo coder option.

Some of the functions are also available via SCPI commands. In this case, it is recommended to use the SCPI commands in order to keep the settings of the R&S SMB and the stereo coder synchronized. Direct command for which a SCPI command is available are marked with “for documentation reasons only” and the SCPI command is given.

The direct commands are sent to the Stereo/RDS Coder with [SOURCE:] STEREO:DIRECT "command string".

Information is queried with STEREo:DIRECT? "command string".

All parameters are string parameters, this is the reason why all of them have to be sent in quotation marks ("— characters are part of the full direct command !").

Prior to using the stereo coder, the stereo modulation of the R&S SMB has to be switched on with command SOURce:STEREO:STATE ON. The SCPI command SOURce:STEREO:AUDIO:FREQUency sets the LF-Generator frequency and command SOURce:STEREO:MMF limits the modulation frequency. These commands have no counterpart in the direct commands.

#### 6.19.1 Remote-Control Commands

STEReo:DIRECT "<FFG>=<RetrNumb>,<DataSeq#1>,<DataSeq#2>,..."

STEReo:DIRECT? "<FFG>"

Transmits data via free format groups (FFGs). A free format group can be filled with any desired data. (5 bits in block B and 16 bits each in blocks C and D of the group).

Setting parameters:

<RetrNumb> Number of retransmissions

<DataSeq> Max. 20 different data sequences can be defined.

10 characters must be specified each per <DataSeq>. Leading zeros, if any, must also be specified.

STEREO:DIRECT "EON-PS=1234, TEST EON"

## 4. Set the group sequence, e.g.:

STEREO:DIRECT "GS=0A,14A"

Group 14A with variants 0 to 3 is now transmitted.

## 5. Create a new AF list for the EON:

a) Using method A

STEReo:DIRECT "EON-AFA=1234,N,87.6,87.7,87.8"
b) Create further AF lists for the EON, using method A:

STEReo:DIRECT "EON-AFA=1234,+88.6,88.7,88.8"
c) Read the first AF list of the EON with

STEReo:DIRECT? "EON-AFA,1234,1"

## 6. Create a new AF list for the EON, using method B:

STEReo:DIRECT "EON-AFB=1234, N, 87.6, 87.7, 87.8"

where 87.6 = tuned frequency,

87.7 = mapped frequency 1(variant 5),

## 1. Define the data to be transmitted in group 1A:

STEReo:DIRECT "1A=05,0000000000,1FFFFFFF"

Group 1A is now transmitted first with "0000000000" and then with "1FFFFFFF. Each of the two data sequences is retransmitted five times, which is indicated by the information "05".

## 2. Set the group sequence, e.g.:

STEREO:DIRECT "GS=0A,1A"

The defined data is now transmitted in group 1A.

Max. 20 different data sequences can be defined.

##### 6.19.2.4 Transparent-Mode

The transparent mode allows the user to transmit freely definable binary data instead of the standard RDS data. Blocks A to D of the RDS groups are used. This means that standard RDS data will no longer be transmitted when transparent data is set. The binary data will be sent even if it constitutes no valid or meaningful RDS data. The transmission of standard RDS data will not be resumed until the transparent data is deleted.

1. Transmit the alternating sequences '0123456789ABCDEF' and 'ABC-DEF0123456789' instead of the RDS data:

STEReo:DIRECT "TRANS=0123456789ABCDEF,ABCDEF0123456789"

2. Delete the transparent data and switch back to standard RDS data transmission with:

STEREO:DIRECT "TRANS=0"

Max. 20 different data sequences can be defined.
