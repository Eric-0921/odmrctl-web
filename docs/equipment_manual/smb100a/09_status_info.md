## 9 Status Information, Error Messages and Troubleshooting

The R&S SMB distinguishes between a variety of different messages such as status messages, error messages, warnings, or information that are displayed in the "Info" line on the screen, and also entered in the error/event queue of the status reporting system.

This section describes the information and status messages concerning the operating status of the instrument and the types of error messages and warnings. Some error messages require that the error must be eliminated before correct instrument operation can be ensured. The info window with a list of current messages and a detailed description of each message can be opened with the [INFO] key.

In the remote control mode, error messages are entered in the error/event queue of the status reporting system and can be queried with the command SYSTEM:ERROR?. If the error queue is empty, 0 ("No error") is returned. The status reporting system is described in detail in Chapter 5.5, "Status reporting system", on page 273.

Section Chapter 9.5, "Resolving network connection failures", on page 505 provides recommended solutions for network connection errors, and helps you to collect the information required for quick and efficient support.

### 9.1 Status Information

The status messages are displayed in the header section of the screen. The status information gives the user an overview of the main operating states and settings of the instrument. The states are indicated for information only and do not necessitate any action by the user. Status information is displayed between the frequency and level fields, at the left of the info line or in the info line itself.

#### 9.1.1 Status information displayed between the frequency and level fields

This section gives an overview of the status messages displayed between the frequency and level fields.

##### RF OFF

The RF output is switched off

##### MOD OFF

All modulations are switched off

##### FREQ OFFSET

A frequency offset is set.

The frequency entered and displayed in the "Frequency" field takes any set frequency offset into consideration, e.g. an offset set for a downstream instrument. This means that with a frequency offset the frequency displayed in the header does not correspond to the frequency at the RF output, but rather to the frequency at the output of the downstream instrument.

This allows the target frequency at the output of a downstream instrument to be entered in the frequency field. The signal generator changes the RF output frequency according to the entered offset.

However, the frequency entered and displayed in the "Frequency/Phase" dialog of the "RF" function block always corresponds to the RF output frequency. Any frequency offset is not taken into consideration.

The correlation is as follows:

Freq in header = RF output frequency (= Freq in dialog) + Freq offset (= Offset in dialog)

##### OVERLOAD

The power of the external signal applied to the RF output is too high. The overload protection is tripped and the connection between the RF output and attenuator is interrupted. The overload protection is reset by pressing the [RF ON/OFF] key. The RF input is activated when the overload protection is reset.

##### LEVEL OFFSET

A level offset is set.

The level entered and displayed in the "Level" field takes the offset of any downstream attenuators/amplifiers into consideration by way of calculation. This means that with a level offset the level displayed in the header does not correspond to the level at the RF output, but rather to the level at the output of the downstream instrument.

This allows the target level at the output of downstream instruments to be entered. The signal generator changes the RF output level according to the set offset.

However, the level entered and displayed in the "Level" dialog of the "RF" function block always corresponds to the RF output level. Any level offset is not taken into consideration.

The correlation is as follows:

Level in header = RF output level (= Level in dialog) + Level offset

##### EXT REF

An external reference is used.

The external signal with selectable frequency and defined level must be input at the [REF IN] connector. It is output at the [REF OUT] connector.

##### BUSY

A setting or calculation is executed.

#### 9.1.2 Status information displayed to the left of the Info line

This section gives an overview of the status messages displayed to the left of the Info line.

##### REMOTE

Indicates that the instrument is in remote control mode.

The keys on the front panel are usable, but all parameters are in read only mode.

To return to manual control, use the [local] key or the command &GTL. The current command must be fully processed before the mode is switched, otherwise the instrument switches immediately back to remote control.

##### REM-LLO

Indicates that the instrument is in remote control mode with local lockout enabled.

The [local] key is locked. To set the local lockout, use the command &LLO (local lockout).

The keys on the front panel are usable, but all parameters are in read only mode.

To return to manual operation or to "REMOTE" state, use one of the following commands:

• &LOCS

swichtes directly from "REM-LLO" to manual operation.

☑ &REMS

changes the remote control state from "REM-LLO" to "REMOTE".

- CALL IBLOC (generator%) (Visual Basic command) switches from remote control state to manual operation.

##### LOC-LLO

For the direct operation the state has been changed from remote control to manual operation (local state). The [LOCAL] key was disabled with the command LLO (local lockout).

With the next activating of the remote control mode, the instrument cannot be switched to manual operation by the operator. The status information changes to "REM-LLO".

The instrument can be switched to manual operation by means of remote control only (e.g. with the Visual Basic command CALL IBLOC (generator)).

#### 9.1.3 Status information displayed in the Info line

This section gives an overview of the status messages displayed in the Info line.

##### RFSweep / LevelSweep / LFSweep

The indicated sweep is enabled.

##### ALC On / Auto / S&H

The status of the automatic level control is indicated:

• ON

automatic level control permanently on

##### Auto

automatic level control is automatically adapted to the operating states

• S&H

automatic level control off, recalibration of the level whenever the level or frequency is set (sample and hold mode)

##### ListMode

List mode is active.

The values of the frequency/level pairs in the selected list are set for the chosen dwell time.

##### AttFixed

Attenuator fixed mode is active.

The uninterrupted level settings are made in a fixed range without attenuator switching. The variation range is set automatically when this mode is activated. The range is displayed under "Attenuator Fixed Range" in the "Level" dialog.

##### UCorr

User Correction is active.

The level is corrected by the given values in the selected user correction list. Correction is performed by the user-defined list values being added to the output level for the respective RF frequency. With frequencies which are not contained in the list, the level correction is determined by interpolation of the closest correction values.

##### OvenCold

The reference oscillator has not yet reached its nominal frequency.

When switching on from the STANDBY mode, the specified frequency accuracy is reached immediately. If the power switch was switched off, the reference oscillator needs some warm-up time to reach its nominal frequency. During this period of time, the output frequency does not yet reach its final value either.

### 9.2 Error Messages

Messages indicate errors in the instrument. They are displayed in the info line in different colors depending on their importance and display duration. Errors (e.g. no calibration data) are displayed in red, information (e.g. file not found) and warnings in black. Warnings indicate less significant errors (e.g. the instrument operates outside specified data).

#### 9.2.1 Volatile messages

Volatile messages report automatic settings in the instrument (e.g. switching off of incompatible types of modulation) or on illegal entries that are not accepted by the instrument (e.g. range violations). They are displayed in the info line on a yellow background. They are displayed on top of status information or permanent messages.

Volatile messages do not normally demand user actions and disappear automatically after a brief period of time. They are stored in the history, however.

SCPI command: :SYSTEM:ERROR:ALL? or :SYSTEM:ERROR[:NEXT] ?

Permanent messages are displayed if an error occurs that impairs further instrument operation, e.g. a hardware fault. The error signaled by a permanent message must be eliminated before correct instrument operation can be ensured.

#### 9.2.2 Permanent messages

The message is displayed until the error is eliminated. It covers the status display in the info line. After error elimination, the message automatically disappears and is also recorded in the history.

SCPI command::SYSTEM:ERROR:STATIC?

### 9.3 SCPI-Error Messages

The SCPI error messages are the same in all SCPI instruments. Detailed information and an overview of all error messages as defined in SCPI standard can be found in the corresponding documentation.

The errors are assigned negative numbers. The error text being entered into the error/event queue or being displayed is printed in bold face on the left together with the error code. Below the error text, there is an explanation as to the respective error.

### 9.4 Device-Specific Error Messages

The following table contains all error messages specific for the instrument in alphabetical order, as well as an explanation of the error situation. The positive error codes mark the errors specific of the instrument.

The device-specific error messages set bit 3 in the ESR register.

##### Bus lines

• Data bus with 8 lines D0 to D7:

The transmission is bit-parallel and byte-serial in the ASCII/ISO code. D0 is the least significant bit, D7 the most significant bit.

• Control bus with five lines:

IFC (Interface Clear): active LOW resets the interfaces of the instruments connected to the default setting.

ATN (Attention): active LOW signals the transmission of interface messages, inactive HIGH signals the transmission of device messages.

SRQ (Service Request): active LOW enables the connected device to send a service request to the controller.

REN (Remote Enable): active LOW permits switchover to remote control.

EOI (End or Identify): has two functions in connection with ATN:

– ATN=HIGH active LOW marks the end of data transmission.

– ATN=LOW active LOW triggers a parallel poll.

• Handshake bus with three lines:

DAV (Data Valid): active LOW signals a valid data byte on the data bus.

NRFD (Not Ready For Data): active LOW signals that one of the connected devices is not ready for data transfer.

NDAC (Not Data Accepted): active LOW signals that the instrument connected is accepting the data on the data bus.

##### Interface Functions
